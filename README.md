## Projects
**Lime Interpretability**

[Interpreting the Swin Transformer through Lime Interpretability](https://github.com/Tasnia16EEE/Lime_Interpretability/blob/main/Lime_Interpretability.ipynb) 

Understanding how deep learning models, such as the Swin Transformer, classify objects is crucial for improving their performance and trustworthiness. This study leverages LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to shed light on the decision-making process of Swin Transformer models. By applying LIME, we aim to identify the important features that influence the model's classifications and gain insights into its internal workings. This interpretability analysis not only helps in debugging and refining the model but also enhances transparency, making it easier to trust and adopt these advanced models in real-world applications. 

**Understanding Feature Importance in Mask2Former**

[Feature Importance of Mask2Former](https://github.com/Tasnia16EEE/Feature-Importance-of-Mask2Former-Model/blob/main/Mask2FormerFeatureimportance.ipynb)

In the realm of computer vision, the Mask2Former model has emerged as a state-of-the-art framework for various tasks such as image segmentation and object detection. Understanding the feature importance in Mask2Former is crucial for interpreting its predictions, improving model robustness, and ensuring transparency in its decision-making process. This repo delves into the mechanisms of Mask2Former, highlighting the significance of different features and their impact on the model’s performance. (on-going)
