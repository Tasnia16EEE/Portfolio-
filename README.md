### Work Experince
**Voluntary Research Work 1 @ University of California Berkely & Caltrans (_Dec 2022 – Current_)**

**PI: Dr. Md. Mintu Miah, Research Data Specialist III, Caltrans**
- Conducted  data collection, cleaning, and processing from different data sources (Count Data, manual or automatic data, Strava Metro App, and StreetLight Data)
- Analyze the data by using the three sets of Poisson regression models: city-specific models, an Oregon pooled model, and all cities pooled to compare the data from different sources by using statistical concepts: regression analysis, analysis of variance, correlation coefficients, statistical significance, and factor analysis.
- Assist in developing different web applications by collecting the data from GIS by using JavaScript, Visual Studio, and HTML.
- Assist in developing a total of 168 cross-validated generalized and city-specific Poisson regression models using emerging data sources (i.e., Strava, StreetLight) and contextual variables.
- Evaluate the effect of data aggregation (buffer) technique on bicycle volume estimation.
- Assist in literature review on bike volume prediction studies.
- Assist in estimating a network Daily Bicycle Traffic using four machine learning regressions (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor) and two conventional approaches (Negative Binomial and Regularized linear Ridge Regression)
